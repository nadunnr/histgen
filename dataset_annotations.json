C. Biliary Stent Removal: Biliary stent, gross diagnosis only. D. Pancreatoduodenectomy: Adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, pancreatic ductal origin, perineural target-vessel, and lymphatic invasion identified. Carcinoma invades the duodenum, common bile duct, Ampulla, and peripancreatic tissue. Adjacent pancreatic parenchyma with panIN 3. Adenocarcinoma involves 1 of 27 lymph nodes 1/27. The attending pathologist personally reviewed all slides and CL materials and rendered the final diagnosis electronically. Comment: The carcinoma seems to be of pancreatic origin based on the presence of extensive pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia and the lack of Ampullary precursors. The bulk of the invasive carcinoma is within the pancreas and secondarily involves the Ampulla and duodenum. Deeper sections were examined of lymph node blocks D31-D32, D41, and D43. Key Pathological Findings: Specimen type: D. Pancreas-Exocrine Synoptic Data. Specimen type: Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple resection), partial pancreatectomy. Tumor site: Pancreatic head. Tumor size: Invasive-1.5 cm. Other Organs Resected: Gallbladder, duodenum, distal stomach. Ductal Adenocarcinoma. Histologic grade: G2-Moderately differentiated. Duodenum, bile duct. Primary Tumor (pT): pT3-Tumor extends beyond the pancreas but without involvement of the celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery. Regional Lymph Nodes (pN): pN1a-Metastasis in single regional lymph node. Number examined: 28, Number involved: 2. Distant Metastasis (pM): pMX: Cannot be assessed. Margins: Margins free of tumor. Venous (large vessel) Invasion (V): Present. Lymphatic (small vessel) Invasion (L): Present. Perineural invasion: Absent. Additional pathologic findings: Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (highest grade: PanIN 3). Comment(s): Lymph node count includes the hepatic artery lymph node. Specimen(s) Received: A. Gallbladder, B. Hepatic Artery Node, C. Biliary Stent Gross Only, D. Whipple 4FS. Clinical History: Ampullary Cancer. Preoperative Diagnosis: Ampullary Cancer. Intraoperative Consultation: FSD1- Pancreatic Margin-Negative, FSD2: Common Bile Duct Margin-Negative, FSD3, FSD4- Retroperitoneal Margin (perpendicular) - Negative. Comment: This frozen section diagnosis/result was communicated to and acknowledged by Dr. in. I,. M.D., who performed the intraoperative consultation(s) and issued the above diagnosis. Gross Description: A. The specimen was received fresh in 4 containers. Specimen A is labeled Gallbladder. The specimen consists of a gallbladder measuring 8 x 4 x 3 cm. The serosa covering the gallbladder is pink-tan to dusky purple, smooth, and glistening. No transmural perforations are grossly identified. The gallbladder's contents consist of a moderate amount of dark green, viscous bile. The mucosa of the gallbladder is elevated and grossly unremarkable. The cystic duct is patent to the flow of bile and has a 0.3 cm in diameter fumen. No lymph nodes are grossly identified attached to the gallbladder's neck. The gallbladder's wall is mildly edematous, averaging 0.3 cm in thickness. No tissue was submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted in 2 cassettes, A1, and A2. B. Specimen B is labeled Hepatic Artery Node. The specimen consists of a single, roughly ovoid, rubbery potential lymph node measuring up to 1.4 cm in greatest dimension. No tissue was submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory. The lymph node is serially sectioned and is submitted entirely in 2 cassettes, B1, and B2. C. Specimen C is labeled Biliary Stent, Gross Only. The specimen consists of a blue plastic tube 13.0 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter. The ends of the tube reveal a patent lumen up to 0.2 cm in diameter. No sticky material is identified on the tube surface. The specimen is received for gross analysis only. D. Specimen D is labeled Whipple; frozen section on retroperitoneal margin, pancreatic margin, bile duct. The specimen consists of a pancreatic head (7 x x 2.5 cm) with attached duodenum (16.0 cm in length and up to 4.5 cm in circumference at the level of the distal resection margin) and distal portion of the stomach (4.5 cm in length and up to 10.0 cm in circumference at the level of stapled gastric resection margin). The stomach's serosa is pink-tan, smooth, and glistening, while the duodenum's outer surface is shaggy with a small amount of fibroadipose tissue attached. There is also a small amount of omental adipose tissue attached to the gastric wall. The peripheral aspects of the pancreatic head are composed of a small amount of adipose tissue ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 cm in thickness. Prior to sectioning, the specimen is inked as follows: Anterior aspect of the pancreatic head-Green, Medial aspect (groove)-Red, Stapled retroperitoneal margin-Orange, The remainder of the posterior aspect of the pancreatic head-Black, Parenchymal resection margin-Black, Common bile duct margin-Blue. On opening, the duodenum reveals an irregular, ill-defined, sessile, focal hemorrhagic tumor measuring 1.5 x 1 cm, which involves the ampulla of Vater. On sectioning, the tumor measures up to 0.5 cm in depth and appears to involve the adjacent portion of the pancreatic head. The tumor also appears to involve the distal portion of the common bile duct and main pancreatic duct. A 1.0 distal cm of the common bile duct and the area of junction between the main pancreatic duct and common bile duct are partly obstructed by the tumor. The dilated portion of the common bile duct located distal to the obstructed area is 0.5 cm from the closest retroperitoneal resection margin and is dilated up to 1.8 cm in circumference. The remaining parenchyma of the pancreatic head is pale yellow, lobulated, rubbery to the firm with some areas of intralobular fibrosis within the parenchyma surrounding the dilated portion of the common bile duct. The portion of pancreatic parenchyma adjacent to the parenchymal resection margin is grossly unremarkable. Several potential lymph nodes are grossly identified within fibroadipose tissue surrounding the pancreatic head. The remaining mucosa of the duodenum and stomach is grossly unremarkable. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for frozen section analysis, and frozen section remnants are submitted in 4 cassettes as follows: FSD1: Pancreatic resection margin, tangential section. FSD2: Common bile duct margin, tangential section. FSD3, FSD4: Retroperitoneal margin (perpendicular cross-sections) closest to the tumor. Additional sections of the specimen are submitted in 39 cassettes, D5-D43, as follows: D5-D6: Gastric resection margin, tangential section. D7: Duodenal resection margin, tangential section. D8: Ampulla of Vater with the adjacent area of the junction between the main pancreatic duct and the common bile duct. D9-D12: The remainder of the tumor involving the ampulla of Vater with adjacent distal portion of the common bile duct.
